    <div>Much effort has been expended on the search for habitable worlds. The unstated goal is to find a second Earth, another home for humanity. But the problem with habitable worlds is that they are inhabited. Oxygen in the atmosphere will probably not
        exist without life of some sort releasing it as a waste product. Aside from the ethical issues, Earth life may not be compatible with alien life and attempts to colonize such worlds may not end well for Humans. All of life on Earth utilizes 20
        very specific amino acids to build the proteins that form us. These amino acids are synthesized within the cells of living plants, animals, and fungi. If a creature cannot make needed amino acids, it must consume other living things, or form mutual
        relationships with other organisms that do make them. Thus, the universe of amino acids that we are exposed to is limited to these very specific 20 amino acids. Earth DNA systems are tailored to direct these amino acids into useful proteins. But
        there are an estimated 600 plus possible amino acids that could exist. It is likely that alien life that evolved completely independently from us utilize a different set of amino acids and ingesting these alien amino acids could disrupt the proper
        functioning of our cells as they try to utilize amino acids with which they have no experience. Proteins utilizing these alien amino acids would not fold properly and would not function as intended. Panspermia offers one possibility that this
        may not be the case. Perhaps Earth cells have the ability to discard alien amino acids. There are experiments that can be conducted in the near term to begin to understand this risk. It may be that when humanity ventures to other solar systems,
        we won't be looking for habitable worlds to colonize. Instead we will be looking for sterile worlds that can be terraformed with Earth Life.</div>
