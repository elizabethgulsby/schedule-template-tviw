    <div>The debate over whether to begin messaging extraterrestrials (active SETI or METI), as opposed to merely listening for their signals, is attracting increasing attention. Much of the debate has centered on the empirical parameters of the question,
        and in particular estimates of the risk involved. But there is a real sense in which these kinds of analyses miss the point. Even if we assume that the risks of messaging are extremely small, they are certainly not zero. And the potential outcome
        could be (quite literally) as bad as it gets: the extermination of all life on Earth. There may be times when scientific paternalism - the idea that scientists should be in control of decision-making regarding issues where the public is poorly
        informed - is warranted. But this is clearly not such a case. </div>
