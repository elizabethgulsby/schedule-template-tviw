    <div>Scholars have long argued that so-called “closed societies” frequently experience severe violenceperpetrated for political motivations. Living in socioeconomic and political vacuum aboard largeworld ships – without inter-societal migration, external
        penetration of ideas, conflict managementand peace-building by external parties, or even regular communications with the outside world –interstellar societies will be especially vulnerable to internal conflict. In such contexts, enmities caneasily
        fester, nonviolent quarrels can escalate into violent conflict, and political disagreement candeteriorate into mass killing of opposition members. Building on recent research into the causesand consequences of conflict, this article examines potential
        salient causes of violence on interstellarworld ships to offer strategies of mitigation and prevention. First, the article identifies commonalitiesand differences between interstellar world ships and some politically vulnerable earth societies
        thatexperienced different scales and types of political violence over the last three centuries. Pathwayslinking socioeconomic and political isolation with the onset and escalation of conflict on earthare then articulated and validated to develop
        empirical models of political violence in vulnerable societies. Second, the strongest predictors of this violence are identified empirically by statistically analyzing large datasets measuring different types of political violence occurring over
        the last halfcentury. Computer simulations are then applied to out-of-sample data, i.e., data not used to compilethe original models, to cross validate the relevant strength of the predictors identified in the previousstage. Third, literature
        on conflict mitigation is then applied to pinpoint strategies to addresseconomic inequalities, promote diversity and education, and provide adequate access to food, all ofwhich can help prevent the onset and escalation of violence in future world
        ship societies. Insofar aslessons form earth societies are applicable to interstellar travel, this article’s findings will assist increating a sustainable, peaceful governance system for future on-board colonies, and facilitate theexpansion and
        even survival of humanity in centuries to come.</div>
