    <div>We continue to push the limits of extrasolar planet detection techniques in pursuit of planets similar to our own. Currently, we have found planets with masses and radii close to the Earth’s. We have also found multiple rocky planets in the habitable
        zone of stars smaller than our Sun. However, searching for Earth-like planets in the habitable zones of solar-type stars is going to depend on improvements in telescope design and our knowledge of the properties of the host star. I will review
        the current state of the art techniques used for detecting extrasolar planets with radial velocities, transits and direct imaging including the advantages and limitations of these detection techniques as we push the boundaries of telescope instrumentation.
        I will also discuss our efforts to learn more about the host stars and how we can use that information to tell the difference between stellar noise and terrestrial-mass planets in our data. With more advanced space- and ground-based telescopes
        on the near horizon, Earth 2.0 is within our grasp, we just need to know how to pick it out of the noise of the Universe. </div>
