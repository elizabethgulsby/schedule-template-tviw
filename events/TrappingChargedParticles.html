    <div>Independent of the actual means of space travel, vast quantities of energy are required to escape gravity wells and to accelerate to speeds significant compared to the speed of light. Of all known forms of energy, antimatter features the highest energy
        per mass ratio - 100%. However, means to confine antimatter in macroscopic amounts are not available. The charge of particles permits control and confinement with electromagnetic fields like in cylindrical Malmberg Penning traps. The challenge
        is to control space charge, the cumulative repulsive force of all stored charges. Foundational work on how to do this is the topic of this presentation. Instead of single massive confinement containers, the charges are divided up into an array
        of cylinders. Metalized walls of the cylinder provide image potentials that shield the charge confined in one cylinder from that in all other cylinder. Electrostatic barriers of the single container of kilovolts in magnitude can be replaced by
        10 volt barriers. Currently, electrons are trapped in up to 10 cylinders of an array built of 20,000 cylinders. Each is 0.1 mm in diameter and up to 100 mm long. They are aligned in a 7 Tesla homogeneous magnetic field. The infrastructure for
        experiments has been developed and set up. Experiments, initially with electrons, are ongoing. First results from storing electrons in parallel tubes, a key element of the concept, will be presented. Electrons were trapped in as many as 4 parallel
        nearest neighbor tubes for 10 milliseconds. Overall trapping was observed for confinement times as long as 700 milliseconds with a half life of on the order of 50 milliseconds. Current and upcoming issues will be discussed. Immediate issues include
        the choice of conductors to provide the image potentials, the alignment within the axial magnetic field, and vacuum pressures. For confinement with practical uses, the next set of questions to address include: What are the ideal configurations
        of these trap arrays? Initial modeling results suggest ever decreasing individual trap diameters. What is the ideal number density in a single trap? Is it a single particle per trap without the benefits of a plasma made up of many particles? How
        comparable is electron storage, as carried out now, to storing anti-electrons, i.e. positrons? Experiments with large traps suggest that increases in length lead to decreases in confinement times, contrary to any theoretical plasma physics models.
        This lead to an alternate proposal to store particles in large numbers of traps with length-to-diameter ratio at currently understood levels. The cost is a vastly increased number of control parameters. I will offer my perspective of the tremendous
        potential of antimatter as a containment of energy and the offset by the scientific and technological challenges on the road to achieving it.</div>
