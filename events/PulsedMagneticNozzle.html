    <div>Pulsed fusion and fission/fusion hybrid propulsion systems can enable rapid interplanetary trip times and precursor interstellar missions with flyby times of 50 to 200 years to the nearest stars. In these so-called pulsed systems, pulsed power drivers
        are typically used to compress a target of fuel to ignition conditions, which burns a secondary layer of fuel and releasing energies of 106 to 109 J per pulse. One of the challenges in these pulsed devices is the means by which an isotropic explosion
        is converted into directed thrust. In a companion paper, we explore the plasma dynamics for a solid state nozzle, but nozzle erosion and wall heating which comes with direct physical contact between the hot plasma may be too severe for space travel.
        Additionally, more advanced nozzles may be needed to assist in energy recovery to recharge the drivers for the fusion or fission/fusion reactor for subsequent shots. Protection of the plasma facing components and recharging of the fusion drivers
        may be accomplished by a magnetic nozzle. This paper presents a 3D plasma simulation of a pulsed magnetic nozzle for z-pinch fusion propulsion. The physics include shock capturing, tabular and Gruneisen equations of state, viscosity, heat transfer,
        radiation, and fast ion stopping power models. One of the main challenges in such a simulation is to produce a code with a self-consistent circuit model and electromagnetic field solver. The circuit model is approximated as a 3D network of transmission
        lines connected to the external circuit, and this models current and voltage throughout the domain including both plasma and solid conductors. Vacuum and dielectric field propagation is modeled with the finite difference time domain. Some initial
        magnetic field topologies will be studied, and specific impulse, impulse bit, and nozzle efficiency will be used to study the effect on mission analysis and design for interplanetary and interstellar precursor missions.</div>
