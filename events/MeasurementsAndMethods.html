    <div>The recent upsurge in novel propulsion proposals for orbital boost, station-keeping, and interstellar transport etc has been accompanied by considerable hype and varying degrees of enthusiasm. Usually lost in the furor are details of how the measurements
        were made and presented which justify the claims of the proponents of the various schemes. This presentation will outline a few of the multitude of ways in which measurements of thrust and power can be misunderstood, misapplied and misstated.
        Based on the authorâ€™s many years of measuring small forces both electrical and mechanical, several recent claims concerning novel propulsion schemes will be analysed to show the strengths and weaknesses of the published measurements and how they
        are used to justify the claims. Confounding issues including testing involving high voltages, in high vacuum, at cryogenic temperatures, in noisy environments, in liquids will be presented in the context of force and electric power measurements.
        A comprehensive list of measurement pitfalls will be presented for discussion.</div>
