    <div>A common underlying concern in interstellar studies is that the awesome energies required to travel into deep space can, if applied on Earth, be used as weapons of mass destruction. Consequently, some argue that humanity is not yet mature enough to
        responsibly handle interstellar technology. This paper seeks to develop a framework to address this concern, using the extensive sociological, historical, and theoretical work on nuclear power (especially weapons) as a case study. Nuclear power
        can serve as an unparalleled case study for interstellar technology. The nuclear case offers a deep reservoir of scholarship to interstellar researchers that can provide much needed insight into the moral and ethical questions of advanced technology.
        The paper will address both sociological theory and historical evidence of the nuclear case study and apply it to the interstellar question. Specifically, this paper will argue in its sociology section that Sheldon Ungar’s “dynamic oscillation”
        model between nuclear worship (nuclear weapons as a source of salvation) and nuclear dread (nuclear weapons as a source of Armageddon) that seemed to occur during the Cold War is applicable to interstellar technology as well. The paper will explore
        historical and modern arguments both for and against nuclear weapons and nuclear power. It will then collect arguments both for and against space travel and interstellar technology and assess whether there are any parallels worth exploring, or
        indeed if the space arguments are simply repackaged nuclear arguments. In its historical evidence section, the paper will explore specific nuclear incidents and modern attempts to using these incidents as proof of nuclear technology’s inherent
        danger. Thereafter, the paper will argue that, while naysayers have consistently argued that doom was around the corner, the reality of the nuclear safety record is quite good because humanity has produced effective safety, training, security,
        and organizational constructs with which to manage nuclear weapons technology in a safe and consistent manner. The professional behavior and safety record of the United States nuclear enterprise must be accounted as a positive indicator that,
        although additional moral progress may be both possible and desirable, the United States is already capable of handling interstellar technology in a responsible manner. In addition, the paper will argue that inordinate preoccupation with “interstellar
        doom” may prove counterproductive to human development by assessing the history of the nuclear pulse propulsion Project Orion. The paper will provide evidence that it was the nuclear arm of the US Air Force, Strategic Air Command (SAC), that was
        the most forceful advocate of Project Orion’s development and deployment. SAC wanted Orion for its deterrence potential, yet was well aware of and supported its capacity as a deep space exploration vessel as well. However, the Limited Test Ban
        Treaty of 1963 (a flagship nuclear doom-ist project) essentially killed Project Orion. Consequently - and ironically – we now arguably have the worst of both nuclear worlds. “Nuclear doom-ism” has not eliminated nuclear power as a weapon of war,
        but it did destroy nuclear power as a positive tool of exploration and deep space transportation.</div>
