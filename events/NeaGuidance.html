    <div>The NEA Scout team combined mechanical design, sail film optical testing, and finite element modeling into a model of solar force and torque as a function of illumination angles. An interstellar sail will require a similar model for beam illumination.
        The torque model used for attitude control will be updated after deployment by steering to different angles and observing reaction wheel momentum accumulation. The force model used for navigation will be updated by observing the orbit perturbation
        during the early mission. Interstellar sails also require accurate force and torque knowledge. Stable attitude and position prevent the sail from flipping over or drifting out of the beam. Even if the sail is stable, off-nominal attitude and position
        oscillations could reduce the average thrust and lead to the trajectory being too far off-course. Accurate modeling before launch will ensure that the sail design is sufficient to achieve the mission. On-orbit testing and updating the force and
        torque models may ensure that guidance to the beam and sail result in the required trajectory. The exercise of designing a solar sail science mission to visit an asteroid are instructive for understanding how to design interstellar sails with
        beam propulsion.</div>
