    <div>Background: Solar or laser driven sails promise many in-space applications. Some missions may benefit from the agile maneuverability and higher efficiency of a diffractive sail, rather than a reflective sail. Objective: Compare the transfer times
        for an Earth-to-Mars rendezvous mission for reflective and diffractive sails. Methods: Idealized parameters are assumed to generate a baseline comparison between sails, including diffractive elements designed at the Littrow and sun-facing configurations.
        Runge-Kutta numerical methods were employed to determine the shortest time to reach Mars while also satisfying boundary conditions for Earth and Mars. Active attitude adjustments (with respect to the sunline) were not considered. Although fixed
        for the entire transfer, the initial sunline attitude was varied to determine the angle at which boundary conditions were matched. Further, the areal density of the sailcraft was varied to determine how the transfer time changes. Results: No penalty
        was found for using a diffractive, over a reflective sail. The time to reach Mars was slightly better for a diffractive sail. Whereas the transfer time for a reflective sail was 1.58 years, it was 1.44 years for both a transmissive Littrow and
        a sun-facing grating (a savings of 51 days). The transfer time did not significantly change as the sail lightness number was varied; however, the boundary conditions of the transfer could not be achieved unless the lightness was greater than 0.08.
        Future optimization studies are expected to reveal quicker transfer times. Conclusions: Diffractive sails may be as effective as (or superior to) reflective sails for several reasons. As shown in this orbit-raising study, diffractive sails reach
        the target in shorter times. What is more, diffractive sails absorb little light and therefore do not suffer the re-radiation problems attributed to reflective materials. Furthermore, transmissive diffractive sails provide opportunities to recycle
        photons â€“ either for multiple sail layers or for converting light into electricity. These advantages will inspire future work to explore optimized sailcraft missions (e.g., using electro-optic control of diffractive meta-films), the development
        of broadband space-qualified diffractive films, and fabrication techniques to produce large area diffractive layers of micrometer-scale thickness.</div>
