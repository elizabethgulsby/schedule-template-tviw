    <div>Concerns about the lives of shipborn loom large over any discussion about the feasibility or permissibility of multi-generation worldship travel. These concerns are exacerbated by recent philosophical work which suggests that exploitation can occur
        across generational divides (e.g., that wanton contemporary resource depletion would be wrong at least in part because it would constitute exploitation of future generations). Thus, shipborn are not mere resources or means to mission success but
        are persons who can be wrongfully exploited if the mission does not provide them with opportunities for dignified and fulfilling lives. A provisional ethical mandate therefore would be that worldship travel is only permissible when it comes with
        a reasonable guarantee that shipborn have such opportunities. However this mandate is not absolute and its force depends on the context and urgency of interstellar migration. For example, such concerns are of diminished importance in last-ditch,
        species-survival situations (as are often envisioned in science fiction, e.g., Stephen Baxterâ€™s Ark). But if, as I would argue is likely, interstellar migration is not urgent from a species-survival perspective and will not be so until either
        (a) the exhaustion of the resources of our solar system, or (b) the expansion of our sun into a red giant, then we have time to pursue a more ideal form of worldship travel that ensures quality of life for the shipborn. This should be seen as
        a hopeful rather than painful development. Indeed, technical, economic, and political barriers to worldship travel are likely to remain at least until there are substantial space-based human populations (i.e., in the millions or billions). With
        the time and experience it will take to settle and thrive, e.g., on Mars and in the asteroid belt, we will have gained substantial knowledge about what forms of social organization, what personal liberties, what population sizes, and what cultural
        adaptations are necessary for dignified and fulfilling lives in lethal extraterrestrial environments. Science fiction may provide a number of cautionary tales, but we should presume neither that its examples are inevitable nor that they are exhaustive.
