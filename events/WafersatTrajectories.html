    <div>The Breakthrough Starshot Initiative has suggested the development of a concept for propelling a small-scale spacecraft by an intense laser beam to interstellar distances [1]. If such a small-scale spacecraft could be accelerated to 20 percent of
        light speed, it could reach the vicinity of the Alpha Centauri system in approximately 20 years. The question arises with what accuracy one must launch a fleet of such spacecraft on an interstellar trajectory so that they will arrive at a target
        close enough to a stellar system for useful measurements. For a beamed energy propulsion system, an initial state vector for the mission will be formed and the spacecraft will depart on a trajectory that will intercept the target stellar system.
        It will be supposed that there is no or minimal active midcourse guidance for the spacecraft. The question to be answered is: with what accuracy does an initial state vector have to be created such that the propagated state makes a reasonable
        encounter with the target? That is, for at least a subset of the fleet to make a close enough encounter. This question is examined by taking into account perturbations on a nominal trajectory by the galactic potential. A numerical simulation is
        run using statistical properties of the initial state and the mean and covariance matrix of the spacecraft final state are determined[2],[3]. [1] P. Lubin, A Roadmap to Interstellar Flight , JBIS, 69, pp.40-72, 2016. [2] R. Battin, An Introduction
