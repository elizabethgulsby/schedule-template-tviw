        <div>1) Laser-powered Electric Propulsion for Interstellar Precursor Missions</div>
        <div>
            <p>Voyager1 is the fastest human-made object and the first to venture into interstellar space;it crossed the heliopause,the boundary separating solar and galactic plasmas, in August 2012 at 120AU from the Sun, 35 years after the launch from Cape
                Canaveral. However, the minimum required distance to reach the unperturbed "virgin" interstellar medium is expected to be at least 200AU. When Voyager1 will cover that distance the on-board power will be too low to operate any scientific
                instrument.
            </p>
            <p>In the last 30 years, the space community has proposed a few concepts for an Interstellar Heliopause Probe which could reach 200AU within a scientist career lifetime (
                <30years), but no solution has been found that does not need extensive technology development.</p>
                    <p>If Planet Nine is confirmed to exist, it could beat 1000AU from the Sun, too far for any realistic mission with current propulsion technology. The Thousand Astronomical Unit (TAU) mission was an interstellar precursor mission concept,
                        studied by JPL scientists in the late 1980s, which could have reached 1000AU within a 50-year trip time. The challenging ∆Vneeded(>100km/s) could be achieved with a nuclear electric propulsion system including a nuclear fission
                        reactor in the 1-MWe class with a specific mass of 12.5kg/kWe and advanced ion thrusters with a specific impulse of 12, 500s. While The NASÁs HiPEP ion thruster has demonstrated a specific impulse of ~10,000s, the needed lightweight
                        nuclear reactor still exists only on paper.</p>
                    <p>This paper proposes an advanced propulsion concept for challenging interstellar precursor missions, Laser-powered Electric Propulsion (LEP). A high-power laser beam is a imedata lightweight photovoltaic (PV) collector on the target
                        spacecraft, where it is converted to electric power for an ultra-high specific impulse EP system. The PV collector/converter on the spacecraft can be tuned to the laser wavelength, thus achieving high monochromatic conversion efficiencies,
                        currently ~50% with the potential to reach 80% in the near future.</p>
                    <p>The TAUmission could greatly profit from the LEP concept. Instead of a heavy weight nuclear reactor we could have a monochromatic PV collector with 50% conversion efficiency and a specific mass of just 1kg/kWe; such a lightweight power
                        source could pave the way to challenging missions beyond the heliopause like Planet Nine and the exploration of the Oort Cloud,with travel times well within a scientist career lifetime.</p>
