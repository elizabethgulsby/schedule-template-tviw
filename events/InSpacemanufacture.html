    <div>Background: NASA's long term goal is to send humans to more distant destinations such as Mars. Current human missions, such as those to the International Space Station (ISS), employ an earth-dependent logistics and sustainability model that is simply
        not plausible for long-duration, Exploration missions. Thus, NASA has established the In-Space Manufacturing (ISM) project to define the technologies, skills, and processes required for on-demand manufacturing, repair, and recycling capabilities
        during human spaceflight missions and to work with private industry and academia to bring these capabilities to fruition. Objective: A significant challenge that is critical to sustainable, long-duration spaceflight missions is the ability to
        manufacture and recycle parts on-demand in space. In order to have a suite of functional ISM capabilities that are compatible with NASAâ€™s exploration timeline, ISM must develop the technologies and foundational processes required and demonstrate
        them on the only human-rated microgravity test-bed available, the ISS, prior to its scheduled de-orbit in 2024. Methods: This presentation will provide an overview of NASA's ISM project, its past and current activities, as well as how the ISM
        Technology Development Roadmap will ultimately culminate in a multi-material, multi-process fabrication laboratory (FabLab) to be deployed on the International Space Station (ISS) in the early 2020s as the test-bed for the first on-demand manufacturing
        facility for long-duration missions. Results: Currently, there are two 3D Printers on the ISS, with the launch of the Refabricator, and integrated 3D Printer/Recycler, anticipated in early 2017. These initial payloads are providing fundamental
        data relative to material, process, and operational aspects of on-demand manufacturing in a space environment. The lessons-learned from these activities are informing the desired technical capabilities and requirements for the FabLab Facility.
        Conclusions: The FabLab will move NASA and private industry significantly closer to changing historical paradigms for human spaceflight where all materials used in space are launched from earth. While the FabLab will be tested on ISS, the system
        is ultimately intended for use in a deep space habitat or transit vehicle. </div>
