    <div>As the Voyagers are crossing in to the ISM and the Kepler Mission has unveiled an abundance of Earth-like planets around other Suns, inevitably, we are faced with the question of how humanity will venture out through the vast space between our star
        and other po-tentially habitable planetary systems. Here, we discussan Interstellar Probe Mission concept arriving at 200 AU within 40 years using today’s technology. The mission would represent the first explicit step scientifi-cally, technologically
        andprogrammatically on the ultimate path to the stars.Venturing on to an escape trajectory offersscience discoveries of different proportions that will naturally bridge planetary, heliophysics and astrophysical disci-plines by putting our own
        planetary system and mag-netic bubble in the context of the apparently ubiquitous exo-planetary systems and astrospheresdetected and characterized.The following topics illustrates the ground-breaking science that could be achieved with an optimized
        payload on board an Interstellar Probe to the ISM.Evolutionary History of Planetary Systems: The evolution of a planetary system is manifested inpart bythe large-scale distribution and motion of dust. Alt-hough dust emits in the infrared wavelengths,
        from a vantage point inside the solar system it is intrinsically difficult to determine itslarge-scale distribution. On its way outward, the Interstellar Probe will measure and determine the radial, compositional and size distribu-tion of dust
        and provide a quantitative picture of the dust distribution that couldbe directlycompared to the IR observations of dust characterizing exo-planetary systems. Diversity of KBO’s: As the New Horizons Pluto flybyhas shown, this extended part of
        our solar system holds a diversity of worlds, which should unlock many of the secrets of the evolution of our solar system, but would more importantly put the evolution of other ex-oplanetarysystems in context. At40-50 AU, conven-iently lining
        upwith the nose direction of the helio-sphereofa flyby in the ~2030’s, lies the dwarf planet Quaoarthat is in the last stages of losingits methane atmosphere. Surprisingly, crystalline ice has been de-tected on the surface implying cryo-volcanism
        active in the immediate past or even still active. Quaoar therefore represents one of the possible targets that could unveil yet another unexpectedly exotic world of a KBO with critical implications for planetary for-mation.Global Nature of Astrospheres:Planetary
        systems are encased in a magnetic bubble spannedby the out-ward stellar wind of its parent star. The global shape and nature of this astrosphereas it plows through its surrounding ISM,is directly constrained by the proper-ties of the stellar wind
        and therefore reveals the habita-ble conditions governed by stellar-wind interactions responsible for the loss of planetary atmospheres.The quest to understand the global natureof our own astro-sphere have illuminated large gaps in understanding
        the exotic plasma-physical processes that take place in this boundary region of astrophysical scales: The in-situ exploration by the Voyagers points to an unex-pectedheated plasma population (not directly meas-ured) dominating the forceshere.
        The glaring absence of the anticipated acceleration region of Anomalous Cosmic Rays also came as a dramatic surprise.Ener-getic Neutral Atom (ENA) images obtained by the Interstellar Boundary Explorermission have revealed a completely unpredicted
        pattern of a thin “ribbon” across the sky that is believed to be organized by the interstellar magnetic field.As it traversesour helio-spheric boundaryinto the pristine ISM, the Interstellar Probe will probethe exotic plasma physics governing
        this unique astro-plasma physical regionand conduct remote ENA imagingof the enormous three-dimensional boundary from multiple vantage pointsto pinpoint the location and physics of the ribbon. As the Probe eventuallyleaves our heliosphere behind,
        it will layclaim to historicalexternal viewsof the heliosphere allowing us to extrapolate and understand other astro- spheres and the habitability of the planetary systems they harbor.A key-enabling component is the availability of a heavy launch
        vehicle such as the SLS. Assuming a probe mass of about 585 kg a couple of different mis-sion scenarios are traded against each other. One con-cept relies on an SLS launchin the 2020’s, followed by a Jupiter Gravity assist that would arrive at
        200 AU in 29 years. Another concept involves asolar-gravity assistarriving at 200 AU in about 39 years. The trade-off between these and others are presented and dis-cussed. All concepts arrive at a not-to-exceed total payload mass around 50 kg.Acritical
        design driveris therefore to develop a highly-integratedspacecraft system and instrument architecturein order to reduce resourcesthat directly translatesto increased energy to reach the ISM. Power generation can be achieved with known radioisotope
        power system (RPS) technology. Use ofMulti-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators will require lifetime extension based on ongoing successful devel-opmentsof new materials, or reclamation of the Si-Getechnology usedby several missions.
        Communication challengescouldbe addressed by using optical com-munications combined withan optical and IR telescope thatwould rely on new sCMOS state-of-the-art tech-nology that will be tested in flight 2017.Although no new technology development
        is required for the helio-physics instrumentation, trade studies are needed to develop anappropriateinstrument suite.The almost indefinite nature of an Interstellar Probe missionnecessitates a transformation in how such en-deavors are supported
        and managed: How is continual funding ensured that goes beyond changing political administrations? How willNASA SMD handle such a mission that naturally brings together three Science Divisions? Howwillrequirements on component and subsystem be
        crafted to support such a mission?How do we create awork beakdown structure for this ambi-tious mission that crosses so many boundaries?</div>
