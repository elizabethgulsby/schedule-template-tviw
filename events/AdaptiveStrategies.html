    <div>Background: In 2016 I presented to TVIW a paper titled "An Adaptive Framework for Permanent Human Space Settlement: Cultural and Biological Evolutionary Dynamics on Interstellar Voyage Timescales", defining and outlining a programmatic and evolutionarily-informed
        study of human space settlement. In this paper I describe research findings in this field to date, specifically regarding whether humanity's biocultural adaptive tools are at Readiness Levels for permanent space settlement. Objective: To investigate
        whether commonly-known units of biocultural replication, variation and selection, and their rates of evolutionary change, are suitable for planning and understanding multigenerational human space settlement, including interstellar voyaging. Methods:
        Literature review in population ecology, genetics, demographic anthropology and culture change studies; computer & mathematical modelling of cultural unit (meme) and genetic unit (gene) change over timescales pertinent to the thoughscape outlined
        in Objective. Results: Despite many offhand arguments that humanity cannot adapt to space, nothing in the realm of genetic viability or cultural viability through time appears to preclude human space settlement in the short term or over timescales
        pertinent to the thoughscape outlined in Objective. Concrete, sample estimates of cultural and biological culture change in an interstellar voyage to an exoplanet within several centuries suggest differences between modern and interstellar migrant
        populations on the order of the differences between modern and Medieval Europeans. Conclusions: In planning for human space settlement and even interstellar voyaging it is important to establish first that our cultural and genetic adaptive systems
        are capable of adaptation to such new selective environments as worldships. Empirical demonstration that this is false, by anthropological studies as carried out in this research, establish that we may reasonably proceed with such plans. This
        research approach is analogous to that carried out in the early years of bioastronautics, when the very viability of the human body in that environment was thoroughly reviewed before flight.</div>
