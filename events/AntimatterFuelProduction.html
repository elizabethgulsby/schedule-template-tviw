    <div>Deceleration of interstellar spacecraft is a highly desirable feature of any unmanned mission to neighboring star systems wherein planets exist that might support life. Antimatter-based propulsion systems are one of a few technology segments that
        have the potential for decelerating spacecraft traveling at velocities greater than 5% of the speed of light. The objection to antimatter-based propulsion is the availability of antimatter in quantities sufficient tosupport such missions. Another
        issue was the preservation of antimatter until deceleration is required. Since December 2016 a series of crowdfunded projects have explored the accelerator physics of antimatter production commensurate with interstellar mission demand. </div>
