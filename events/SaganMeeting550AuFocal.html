    <div>By Einstein’s general theory of relativity, gravity of a massive body deflects light, and thus the sun can be used as a lens. The focus of the sun’s gravitational lens is about 550 AU . (The sun continues to act as a lens beyond this minimum ; at
        longer distances, the focused light passes increasingly far from the solar limb.) A mission to the gravitational focus of the sun, beyond the edge of the solar system, but far closer than the nearest stars, could be a target for an interstellar
        precursor. Proposed methods of reaching the focal distance include electric propulsion or laser- or solar sails. An objective for such a mission is to use the gravitational lens to image and map an extrasolar planet.
