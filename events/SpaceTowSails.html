    <div>The Space Tow Sail Architecture (STSA) is a train of solar and/or laser reflective gossamer sails integrated with a tension truss column. The STSA enables larger area solar sails to be developed directly from smaller sail designs by avoiding growth
        in the boom diameter and mass required to span larger distances. Interstellar sailcraft proposed to date require gossamer structures with lightness well beyond known practical limits. Instead lightweight longeron filaments in a STSA connect a
        stack of smaller sails resembling the configuration of a tandem kite. STSA offsets growth, not with increase in boom mass, but with much less massive longeron tethers. Conventional single large sailcraft areas with heavier booms also make guidance
        and control more difficult. Increased action distance required of an offset mass attitude control system or higher inertia to be moved by a reaction wheel or gas jet thruster are problematic. An STSA is controlled by an actuated offset mass and/or
        steering vanes sized only to maneuver the lead sail in the stack. This presentation will include (1) description of a 6U spacecraft with over 1000 m2 total sail area composed of twelve 85 m2 sails in a tow architecture, (2) Solar System mission
        escape trajectory, and (3) heritage with existing space hardware.</div>
