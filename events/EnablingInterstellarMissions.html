    <div>Large scale directed energy offers the possibility of radical transformation in a variety of areas including the ability to achieve relativistic flight that will enable the first interstellar missions. In addition this enables very rapid interplanetary
        transit. All current propulsion systems that leave the Earth are based on chemical reactions. Chemical reactions, at best, have an efficiency compared to rest mass of 10-9(or about 1eV per bond). All the mass in the universe converted to chemical
        reactions would not propel even a single proton to relativistic speeds. While chemistry will get us to Mars it will not allow interstellar capability in any reasonable mission time. Barring new physics we are left with few solutions. However recent
        advances in photonics and directed energy systems now allow us a path forward to realize the possibility of relativistic flight. With spacecraft from fully-functional gram-level wafer-scale systems (“wafer sats”) capable of speeds greaterthan
        c/4that could reach the nearest star in 20 years to spacecraft for large missions capable of supporting human life withmasses more than 105 kg (100 tons) for rapid interplanetary transit that could reach speeds of greater than 1000 km/s can be
        realized. With this technology spacecraftcan be propelled to speeds currently unimaginable. Photonics, like electronics, and unlike chemical propulsion is an exponential technology with a current double time of about 20 months. It is this point
        that is the keyto this technology. In addition, the same photon driver can be used for many other purposes such as planetary defense, space debris vaporization and de-orbiting, beaming energy to distant spacecraft, beaming power for high Isp ion
        engine missions, asteroid mining, sending power back to Earth for high value needs, stand-off composition analysis, long range laser communications, SETI searches, kilometer class telescopes among others. This would be a profound change in human
        capability, one whose scientific and societal implications would be enormous. Known as Starlight, NASA began our Phase I funding in April 2015. On April 12, 2016 the Breakthrough Foundation announced that they would support this effort with a
        100M$ Research and Development program called Breakthrough Starshot that would explore the fundamental technology underlying this. On May 12, 2016 NASA announced Phase II funding. On May 23 the FY 2017 congressional appropriations request directs
        NASA to study the feasibility of an interstellar mission to coincide with the 100thanniversary of the moon landing using quoting our NASA program as one option.</div>
