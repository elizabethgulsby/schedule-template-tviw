    <div>All propulsion systems that leave the Earth are based on chemical reactions. Chemical reactions, at best, have an efficiency compared to rest mass of 10-9 (or about 1eV per bond). All the mass in the universe converted to chemical reactions would
        not propel even a single proton to relativistic speeds. While chemistry will get us to Mars it will not allow interstellar capability in any reasonable mission time. Barring new physics we are left with few realistic solutions. None of our current
        propulsion systems, including nuclear, are capable of the relativistic speeds needed for exploring the many nearby stellar systems and exo-planets. However recent advances in photonics and directed energy systems now allow us to realize what was
        only a decade ago, simply science fiction, namely the ability to seriously conceive of and plan for relativistic flight. From fully-functional gram-level wafer-scale spacecraft capable of speeds greater than c/4  that could reach the nearest star
        in 20 years to spacecraft for large missions capable of supporting human life with masses more than 105 kg (100 tons) for rapid interplanetary transit that could reach speeds of greater than 1000 km/s can be realized. With this technology spacecraft can
        be propelled to speeds currently unimaginable. Photonics, like electronics, and unlike chemical propulsion is an exponential technology with a current double time of about 20 months. This is the key. The cost of such a system is amortized over
        the essentially unlimited number of launches. In addition, the same photon driver can be used for many other purposes including planetary defense. This would be a profound change in human capability with enormous implications. Known as Starlight
        we are now in a NASA Phase II study. On April 12, 2016 the Breakthrough Foundation announced that they would support this idea with a 100M$ Research and Development program called Breakthrough Starshot to explore the fundamental technology involved.
        The FY 2017 congressional appropriations request directs NASA to study the feasibility of an interstellar mission to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the moon landing quoting our NASA program as one option. We will discuss the many technical
        challenges ahead, our current laboratory prototypes and recent data as well as the transformative implications of this program.
