    <div>The objective of this work is to demonstrate the feasibility of missions using Direct Fusion Drive. The missions analyzed are to 550 AU and to Alpha-Centauri. Both flyby and orbital missions are analyzed. Methods: Conceptual designs of the starships
        were performed. Trajectories for the missions were designed. The critical parameter of specific power is discussed and comparisons made with other technologies. Straight line equations were used for both orbital and flyby missions. These equations
        allow a mapping specific power, engine efficiency and tank structural fraction against different missions. Results: A flyby to 550 AU can be done in 13 years and a mission to stop at 550 AU can be done in 18 years with a specific power of 1 kW/kg.
        When the spacecraft reaches its target, the propulsion system switches to power mode and can transmit data at better than 5 Mbps. With a 300 kg payload, these missions can be launched on a variety of boosters into LEO for a spiral to escape velocity.
        A 300 kg payload flyby of Alpha-Centauri can be done in 550 years with a specific power of 3 kW/kg. Maps of mission duration versus specific power and efficiency are presented. Neutron damage to the superconducting coils is a critical life-limiting
        factor. Conclusions: Direct Fusion Drive enables a wide variety of ambitious interstellar missions. The critical parameters of thruster efficiency and specific power for the Direct Fusion Drive engine need to be refined with more detailed analyses
        and design.</div>
