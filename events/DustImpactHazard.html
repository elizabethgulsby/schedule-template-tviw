    <div>Background. Interstellar vehicles will collide with approximately 100 dust grains larger than 0.5 Âµm per mm, 2 per ly. Travelling at approximately 10% of the speed of light, the collisions will be very energetic. For thin structures, such as light
        sails, grains pass through with little damage [Early and London, J. Spacecraft and Rockets, 37, 526 (2000)]. However, for thick structures, all the grain energy will be deposited, possibly leading to significant damage. Objective. The aims of
        this work are a quantitative assessment of damage caused by grain-vehicle collisions and designs to reduce damage. Methods. Computational simulations of grain-vehicle collisions were performed with HYDRA, a radiation/hydrodynamic code developed
        for inertial confinement fusion research at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory [Marinak, et al., Phys. Plasmas 8, 2275 (2001)]. HYDRA models the deposition of energy in the material, transport out of the heated cylinder by conduction and
        radiation, expansion of the heated volume, and melting and other damage processes to the surrounding material. Results. We quantify the expected volume damaged by grains of various sizes and composition as a function of vehicle speed. We find
        that the energy is deposited initially in a long, thin cylindrical volume, creating temperatures larger than 107 K. The spreading of this energy can potentially lead to a large damaged volume, of order 0.05 mm3. Radiation and evaporation can remove
        energy, thereby limiting the damage. We explore the reduction of damage by the choice of shield material on the leading surface. In addition, we find that a thin shield placed in front of the vehicle can reduce damage by atomizing and ionizing
        the grains. Imposition of a high electrostatic voltage (~ 5 MV) can deflect ions from both interstellar dust and gas, further reducing damage. Conclusions. Collisions with dust grains can damage interstellar vehicles. Damage can be reduced by
        using optimal materials on the leading side, by using a leading thin foil to atomize the grains, and by electrification of the vehicle.</div>
